# Release 0.5-beta

## Highlights
- **Thermostat mirroring:** You can now select thermostats whose setpoint changes will be mirrored into PowerClimate. This makes it easier to coordinate setpoints across multiple devices and keep PowerClimate in sync with manual changes.
- **Improved configuration flow:** The setup and options flow now allow you to select thermostats to mirror, with the first mirrored thermostat preselected for the water heat pump if desired.
- **Refactored device logic:** Internal logic for device configuration and setpoint mirroring has been streamlined, removing legacy options and simplifying the codebase.
- **Updated documentation:** Both English and Dutch documentation have been updated to reflect the new mirroring feature and improved setup instructions.

## Other changes
- Minor bug fixes and code cleanups.
- Updated translation strings for improved clarity.
